# Tandem Tools To Export SCSS From Sketch

This Sketch plugin is built to enhance the overall workflow at [DevMynd](https://www.devmynd.com). It comes with three functions:

### Export as SCSS
This takes all layer styles and type styles and exports them as SCSS variables and mixins.  There are some neat little tricks you can use with the style naming to unlock additional features.

### Scale Type Ramp
Ever heard of a [modular type ramp](http://gridlover.net/try)? This lets you make and adjust them in a hurry, provided you use a type style naming convention.

### Align Text
Stop the ever-frustrating alignment problems with type styles overriding your text alignment. Requires specific symbols with specific naming conventions.
